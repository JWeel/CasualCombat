Day 1:
* Make up idea for app, write proposal

Day 2:
* Discover first idea was not good
* Make up different idea for app, write new proposal
* Design problem: What classes to make (how to structure project)
* Design choice: Game class works on its own

Day 3:
* Start towards prototype
* Design problem: How to handle turns, rounds, moves
* Design choice: During every round one by one all Combatants have a move, sorted by speed value

Day 4:
* Write design doc
* Re-write some code based on design doc

Day 5:

* Get new ideas during presentation - not all moves in round at once. One "move" handled per button touch.
* Add two new skill values

Day 6:
* Streamline interaction between Game and PlayPage
* Design problem: How to handle "log messages"
