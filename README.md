# Casual Combat

An app for a turn based combat game.

In this game, the player fights turn-based battles, becoming more powerful after each battle. After a battle, gold and level up points are earned, and the player is taken to a shop. Here, gold can be used to buy items, equipment and spells, and level up points can used to improve the player character's skills. They then continue to the next battle.
